# Node
The browser has been running JavaScript for decades.

**JavaScript is awesome!**
- Single-threaded, event-driven architecture is very fast (execution and development)
- Supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP)
- Large, open-source community provides an ever expanding library ecosystem

NodeJS took the JavaScript engine out of the browser and let's you execute code directly on the Operating System.

## Security
Websites are generally untrusted.  The scripts run in the browser are extremely locked down for security reasons.  It is not allowed access to your file system, your browser history, etc.

NodeJS doesn't just run JavaScript outside of the browser, but it also runs as the current user, which means it inherits your user's security privileges.  This brings with it the ability to manipulate files, etc.

## As an application
NodeJS can allow programs and utilities to be created and used on your computer.

Electron is an open-source, cross-platform software framework built upon NodeJS that provides user interfaces for extremely powerful applications.

Visual Studio Code is an Electron app (NodeJS).  Each file you open is actually a Chromium browser and the editor is completely powered by JavaScript.

## As a web server
NodeJS can also be used as a webserver. [Usage statistics of Node.js](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ws-nodejs)
